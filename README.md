# Pancake-Problem
Finding number of flips in a pancake problem

Summary:

Computing the maximum number of flips or prefix reversals it takes to sort a given permutation
of numbers or pancakes into a sorted stack using pancake sorting algorithm.It is also equivalent
to finding the diameter of a pancake graph i.e. a graph with different permutations of the stack
as its nodes and edges representing 1 prefix reversal between the nodes it connects. Finding the
maximum number of flips to sort a stack of pancakes has important applications in finding
latency in networks with pancake graph as a topology
